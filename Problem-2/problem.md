Problem 2: MPI Hello World

1. Write mpi_hello_world.c that initializes MPI, prints its own rank, prints the world size, and uses MPIâ€™s broadcast function to broadcast a value from rank_0 to other ranks. Print the broadcasted value from all ranks. 
2. Build your code with cmake and run it. 

When you are done, something like this must work:

cd project2
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make 
mpirun -np 8 ./mpi_hello_world
